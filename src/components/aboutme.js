       		I am front end web developer with masters in computer applications. I have more than 5 years of experience in middleware and front end development but focus solely on front end. </p>
		<p style={{ width: '75%', margin: 'auto', paddingTop: '1em'}}> I am really passionate about what I do and feel high degree of satisfaction by making webpages look beautiful, interactive and user friendly. I try my best to keep upto speed with whats happening in my sector and spend a good amount of time learning new technologies and refreshing my skills. I enjoy the challenge of being the only front end developer in my current company and working with creative and design team to take their designs and make them into something users can interact with.
		When I am not writing code I do caligraphy and painting. I have recently moved to the UK and hence spend alot of my weekends exploring the city and nearby areas.
